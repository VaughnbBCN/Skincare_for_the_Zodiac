Communication Contract 

Requesting Data
The client.py page is an example of client code you can use to request data from this microservice. When you run the code,
you can directly input a starsign and the server will return a piece of skincare advice relevant to the starsign.
When the client code is run, the current prompt (which you may modify) is "Enter your star sign:" 

Receiving data
You should install pika. Then you should run the server file before running the client code. The server will be listening for the data request and return it when asked. When you look at server.py, you can see the skincare tips that the server will provide. 

So: 
install pika
download server.py and client.py 
use an IDE to open both files and a terminal for each (I used VSCode). 
in the first terminal, enter: python3 server.py 
in the other terminal, enter: python3 client.py 
input a starsign when prompted and receive a skincare tip
